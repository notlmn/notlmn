Hey there 👋

I'm **Laxman**,  I work on OSS, mostly into web technologies.

Here's some stuff that you might like to know about me:

- 🎒 I work for Google, from India 🇮🇳, helping Googlers stay productive as part of the global tech support team.
- 🎨 I created [browser-extension-template](https://github.com/notlmn/browser-extension-template/), and [release-with-changelog](https://github.com/notlmn/browser-extension-template/), to ease creating and publishing browser extensions.
- 💻 I'm a core developer on the [Refined GitHub](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github/), and [Notifier for GitHub](https://github.com/sindresorhus/notifier-for-github/) browser extensions.
- 🧰 I prefer using [vanillaJS](http://vanilla-js.com/), micro-frameworks like [preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact/), and [lighterhtml](https://github.com/WebReflection/lighterhtml/).
- 💣 Here is a list of [browser extensions](https://github.com/notlmn?tab=repositories&q=browser-extension&type=source), and a list of [rollup plugins](https://github.com/notlmn?tab=repositories&q=rollup-plugin&type=source) I created.
- 📁 I have my own [dotfiles](https://github.com/notlmn/.dotfiles/) repository, and create useless stuff at [ramlmn](https://github.com/ramlmn/).

Feel free to hit me up on the [birdsite](https://twitter.com/bytemode), [reddit](https://reddit.com/u/notlmn), or drop an email (you know where to find it 😉).
